# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to show our client, Louise, how different Kickstarter campaigns faired in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.  Louise's play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time, and she wanted to know of any correlations between launch dates and funding goals and if they were successful or not.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the data for theatrical Kickstarters, the months with the hightest successful Kickstarter campaigns in a "Theater" genre are May, June, and July.  However, the months with the highest failed Kickstarter campaigns are also May, June, July, along with October.  

The most likely reason for this correlation is that the majority of campaings start at the same time.  Throughout the majority of the year, the campaigns that were successful and the campaigns that failed followed the same chart trajectory for the same months.  The same rate of successful campaings is similar to the rate of failed campaigns during the same months.

Canceled campaigns remained at the same rate throughout the year, near zero.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on the data for plays, 72% of plays with a goal of $1,000 or less failed.  87% of plays that started with a goal of $1,000 to $4,999 were successful.  $100 of Kickstarters with a goal of $10,000 to $14,999 and $35,000 to $39,999 were successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge regarding analyzing this data set is the lack of information regarding Kickstarter campaigns that were canceled.  Another challenge to sift through was that the overwhelming majority of plays had fundraising goals less that $5,000.
